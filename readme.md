## Development

When developing use:
- `npm start`

A development server will automatically open the project in your browser. Normally here: `http://localhost:8080`.


To build the project use:
- `npm run build`

A web ready folder will be created in `/dist/web/`.
A browser addon/extension ready zip will be created in `/dist/extension/`.
